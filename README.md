## Calculator Manual
Upon launching the Quaternary Calculator, a calculator appears with quaternary numbers (0-3) and basic operations. The user can do operations like a normal calculator can except for this being in quaternary. The user can also click the decimal toggle button at the top-right corner to toggle decimal view.
